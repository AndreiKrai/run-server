docker-compose up: Starts all services defined in docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d: Runs containers in the background
docker-compose up --build: Forces rebuilding of images before starting

Stopping Containers
docker-compose down: Stops and removes containers and networks
docker-compose down -v: Same as above but also removes volumes (database data)
docker-compose stop: Just stops containers without removing them
